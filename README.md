# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my machine learning projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Python-based machine learning projects that I've worked on. Each project is organized into its own folder, where you can explore detailed information, code, and documentation for that specific project.



### Project List
**Amazon Recommender System:** a recommendation system to predict the ratings and popularity of products on Amazon, using collaborative filtering to recommend products.

**Stock Price Prediction:** analyzing the risk of a stock based on its previous performance history, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict future stock prices.

**California Housing Prices:** analyzing how different factors affect housing prices, using Linear Regression Model and Random Forest Model to predict housing prices.



### Feel free to navigate to each project's folder by clicking on the links above. Inside each project folder, you will find:

Code: The Python code for the machine learning model and any related scripts.

Documentation: Detailed information, explanations, and instructions for running the project.

Data: Datasets used for training and testing the model.

Results: Reports, charts, or any output generated by the project.
